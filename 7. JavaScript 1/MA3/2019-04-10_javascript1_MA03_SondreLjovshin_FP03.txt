JavaScript MA03
----------------
Level 2

1. In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is.
 I would describe JavaScript Code Style as how you write your code, considering naming conventions, use of whitespace and indentations.

2. What is a Regular Expression?
 Regular Expression is a string of characters that define a pattern used to search for spesific text in a string.

3. What does the .random() method do? 
 .random() is s method of the Math object, it will produce a number between 0 and 1.

4. What does the .sort() method do?
 .sort() is a method of the Array object, it will sort the elements of an array alphabetically.

5. What does the .reverse() method do?
 .reverse() is a method of the Array object, it will reverse the order of the elements in an array.

6. List two examples of bad JavaScript code.
 example one: using "=="
    var a = "55";
    var b = 55;
    if(a == b){
        //this statment will be true regardless of the type of the arguments, because it will mutate "a" tp the same type as "b".
    }

 example two: blockless statments (it makes the code obscure)
    for(i = 0; i > 10; i++)
       console.log(i); <- part will be ran 10 times

    someFunc(); <- this will be ran once because its not a part of the for loop.

7. What data types can a JSON object contain?
 JSON can contain Objects, Arrays, Strings, Numbers, Booleans and Null.

8. What is minifying JavaScript Code?
 Minifying or minification is the process of removing unnecessary data from you code without affecting how the browser precesses it.
 example:
--------- normal, with comments ---------
 //declaration
    var someVariable;
 //Value assignment
    someVariable = 88;
 //function that displays 
    function logVariableToConsole(){
        console.log(someVariable);
    }
 //Call function
    logVariableToConsole();

------------- Minified --------------
var sv=88;function lvtc(){console.log(sv);}lvtc();


9. What is a global variable?
 A global variable is a variable that can be accessed and changed from any place in the code.
